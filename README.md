# spike-vagrant-osx

An experiment with getting an OSX guest running with Vagrant so this might eventually be used to test [Sprout](https://github.com/pivotal-sprout/sprout).

### Dependencies

1. [Vmware Fusion](http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion/overview.html)
1. [Packer](http://www.packer.io/)
1. [Vagrant 1.3+](http://www.vagrantup.com/)
1. Vagrant's [Vmware Fusion Provider](http://www.vagrantup.com/vmware)
1. Tim Sutton's [osx-vm-templates](https://github.com/timsutton/osx-vm-templates) for building an OSX box with Packer
1. [ServerSpec](http://serverspec.org/)

### Creating an OSX box for Vagrant with Packer

1. Clone Tim Sutton's [osx-vm-templates](https://github.com/timsutton/osx-vm-templates)

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/timsutton/osx-vm-templates
    ```

1. Extract a Packer compatible image from the [OS X Mountain Lion installer](http://osxdaily.com/2012/07/26/redownload-os-x-mountain-lion-mac-app-store/)

    **Caveat:** The installer can't to be downloadable on newer Macbook Airs running OS X 10.8.4 (12E3067)

    ```
    cd osx-vm-templates
    sudo prepare_iso/prepare_iso.sh "/Applications/Install OS X Mountain Lion.app" out
    ```

    Take note of the checksum of the generated image and its full path from the output of this command, you'll need this in a moment.

1. Edit the Packer template [packer/template.json](https://github.com/timsutton/osx-vm-templates/blob/master/packer/template.json)

    1. Change [iso_checksum](https://github.com/timsutton/osx-vm-templates/blob/master/packer/template.json#L8) to the checksum of the image generated earlier
    1. Change [iso_url](https://github.com/timsutton/osx-vm-templates/blob/master/packer/template.json#L9) to the absolute path of the image generated earlier, keep the `file:///` prefix.
    1. Remove the `chef-omnibus.sh` and `puppet.sh` scripts from the list of [provisioners](https://github.com/timsutton/osx-vm-templates/blob/master/packer/template.json#L35)
    1. Don't forget to save the file!

1. Create a new box with Packer

    ```
    cd packer
    packer template.json
    ```

1. Add the box generated earlier to Vagrant

    ```
    vagrant box add osx packer_vmware_vmware.box
    ```

### Starting the OSX guest with Vagrant

1. Clone this repo

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/hiremaga/spike-vagrant-osx
    ```

1. Start vagrant using this repo's Vagrantfile

    ```
    cd spike-vagrant-osx
    vagrant up --provider vmware_fusion
    ```

### Run specs

```
bundle install
bundle exec rspec
```

If everything is setup correctly the output should be:

```
â†’ bundle exec rspec

Command "uname"
  should return stdout "Darwin"
